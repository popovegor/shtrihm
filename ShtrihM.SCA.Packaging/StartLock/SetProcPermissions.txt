Betreff:	SetProcPermissions
Josef this documented API is supposed to give a process access to the address space of another process.

	//Make me Master of the Universe
	SetProcPermissions(0xffffffff);

This maybe what you need to use SetWindowLong to hook the window procedure of another process.

Best regards,
